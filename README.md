# IBM_Internship-Analysis_of_superstore
I have completed my project on Analyzing the dataset of superstore, which was given by IBM Skill Build.  This project is an analysis of sales data from a Superstore, aiming to gain insights and understand key trends in the store's performance. The analysis is conducted using Python and various data analysis libraries such as pandas and matplotlib.
