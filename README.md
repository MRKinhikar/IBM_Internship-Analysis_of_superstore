# IBM_Internship-Analysis_of_superstore
I have completed my project on Analyzing the dataset of superstore, which was given by IBM Skill Build.  This project is an analysis of sales data from a Superstore, aiming to gain insights and understand key trends in the store's performance. The analysis is conducted using Python and various data analysis libraries such as pandas and matplotlib.

Key Objectives:
1. Explore and clean the Superstore dataset: The initial step involves loading and cleaning the data, handling missing values, duplicates, and converting date columns to the appropriate format.
2. Analyze sales performance over time: Visualize and examine the total sales over time to identify any seasonal patterns or trends.
3. Identify top-selling products and categories: Determine the products and categories that contribute the most to the overall sales.
4. Investigate customer buying behavior: Discover the customers who make the most purchases and analyze their preferences.
5. Assess the impact of shipping modes: Examine the usage and effectiveness of different shipping modes.
6. Find regional performance: Analyze sales data based on the regions or states to identify high-performing areas.
7. Present findings in visualizations: Utilize matplotlib to create insightful graphs and plots that communicate the key findings effectively.
